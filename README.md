# PostureDetection
This project implements an end-to-end posture detection system using IMU sensor data collected from the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. A lightweight neural network is trained offline and deployed on the microcontroller using TensorFlow Lite Micro to perform real-time posture classification across multiple body orientations and sensor configurations.
